# chatbottest
Taking a walk into chatbot land, incorporating a simple chatbot built on top of an HTML page to answer questions around Turners 'Online Auctions' FAQ.
Some learns, your Intents, Contexts (input and output) are largely the most important things you can integrate within your chatbot, I struggled a little with the assumption that I could just input information and dialogflow would pick it up. 
Future of this project would include, better mapping, maybe even go old-shcool and map the intents out and not rely soley on the Q&A's to gather than information for you. User steps, or possible UX is great here to get an idea. 
Testing, this bot to be more realistic would require some testing to ensure that the intents and questions that are possible with the Online Auction feature are covered off.

Built With:
*HTML
*CSS
*JAVASCRIPT
*GOOGLE DIALOGFLOW
